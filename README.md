# Hi, I'm Jonathan 👋

I am a Master student in Data Science at KULeuven, currently doing an Erasmus exchange at Politecnico di Milano. 

I am interested in research projets at the intersection of Data Science and Social Sciences, 
including : 

             💸 Fraud Detection
             🌍 Social Network Analytics
             👥 Multiagent Systems 
             💬 Natural Language Processing
            
# My journey 

- 📚 Started my master in September 2020
- 📈 Soon after, I discovered the beauty of SARIMA models for [time series](https://github.com/jtonglet/Time-Series-Analysis)  analysis
- 📺 During my Erasmus, I took part in the Polimi RecSys challenge and built a [TV show recommender system](https://github.com/jtonglet/Recommender-Systems-Polimi)
- 🚀 I learned how to use TensorFlow and Keras for [Image classification](https://github.com/jtonglet/Deep-Learning-HW1-Leaf-Classification) and Time Series Forecasting
- 🐤For my thesis, I am correcting  the demographic biases of Twitter user samples, in partnership with Statistics Flanders
