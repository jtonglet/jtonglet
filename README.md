Hi, I am Jonathan Tonglet and I am a Master student in Data Science at KULeuven. 

I am interested in research and projets at the intersection of Data Science and Social Sciences, 
including : 

             💸 Fraud Detection
             🌍 Social Network Analytics
             📈 Time Series Analysis
             💬 Natural Language Processing
            

I'm currently doing an exchange at Politecnico di Milano where I study Deep Learning, Recommender Systems and Multiagent Systems.
