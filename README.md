Hi, I am Jonathan Tonglet and I am a Master student in Data Science at KULeuven. 

I am interested in research and projets at the intersection of Data Science and Social Sciences, 
including : 

             💸 Fraud detection
             🌍 Social network analytics
             📈 Time Series analysis
             💬 Natural Language Processing
            

I'm currently learning more on recommender systems and churn prediction.
