# Hi, I'm Jonathan 👋

I am a Master student at KULeuven, majoring in Data Science.

I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of Data Science and Social Sciences, 
including : 

             💬 Natural Language Processing
             🌍 Social Network Analytics
             👥 Multiagent Systems 
             💸 Fraud Detection
             
            
# My journey 

- 📚 Started my master's degree in September 2020
- 📈 Soon after, I discovered the beauty of SARIMA models for [time series](https://github.com/jtonglet/Time-Series-Analysis)  analysis
- 🍕  I went on Erasmus exchange to Politecnico di Milano, where I took courses on Deep Learning, [Multiagent Systems](https://github.com/jtonglet/Nash_Q_Learning), Data and Information Quality, and Recommender Systems
- 📺  I participated in the Polimi RecSys challenge and built a [TV show recommender system](https://github.com/jtonglet/Recommender-Systems-Polimi)
- 🚀 I learned how to use TensorFlow for [Image Classification](https://github.com/jtonglet/Deep-Learning-Homework) and Time Series Forecasting
- 🐤 For my thesis, I  [predicted demographic attributes and corrected biases](https://github.com/jtonglet/Twitter-Selection-Bias) in Twitter user samples, in partnership with Statistics Flanders
- 🤖 In 2022-2023, I will pursue an advanced Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at KULeuven
