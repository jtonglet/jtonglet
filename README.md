# Hi, I'm Jonathan 👋

I am a Master student at KULeuven, majoring in Data Science.

I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of Data Science and Social Sciences, 
including : 

             🌍 Social Network Analytics
             💬 Natural Language Processing
             👥 Multiagent Systems 
             💸 Fraud Detection
             
            
# My journey 

- 📚 Started my master in September 2020
- 📈 Soon after, I discovered the beauty of SARIMA models for [time series](https://github.com/jtonglet/Time-Series-Analysis)  analysis
- 🍕  I went on Erasmus exchange to Politecnico di Milano, where I followed courses on Deep Learning, [Multiagent Systems](https://github.com/jtonglet/Nash_Q_Learning), Data Quality, and Recommender Systems
- 📺  I took part in the Polimi RecSys challenge and built a [TV show recommender system](https://github.com/jtonglet/Recommender-Systems-Polimi)
- 🚀 I learned how to use TensorFlow and Keras for [Image classification](https://github.com/jtonglet/Deep-Learning-HW1-Leaf-Classification) and [Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/jtonglet/Deep-Learning-HW2-Forecasting)
- 🐤 For my thesis, I am [predicting demographic attributes and correcting biases](https://github.com/jtonglet/Twitter-Selection-Bias) in Twitter user samples, in partnership with Statistics Flanders
- 🤖 In 2022-2023, I will follow an advanced Master in Artificial Intelligence at KULeuven
